<h1 align="center">🕹️ <strong>Welcome to Week-1!</strong></h1>


In Week-1, we’ll cover the basics of Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, and PyGame — everything you’ll need to start building your Flappy Bird AI from scratch.

Our focus this week:

Get comfortable writing and running Python code.

Learn how to manipulate data using NumPy.

Create simple plots using Matplotlib.

Understand how PyGame works to build interactive games.

🧩 1. Python Resources

Throughout this project, we’ll primarily use Python.
While an in-depth knowledge isn’t required, you should be familiar with:

Data types and variables

Lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets

Loops and conditionals

Functions and classes

File I/O (reading and writing files)

Recommended Resources:

🎥 Python in One Video (freeCodeCamp)

🌐 W3Schools Python Tutorial

Practice Ideas:

Write a function that prints numbers divisible by 3 from 1–100.

Create a dictionary to store player scores and print the highest scorer.

Write a program that reads and writes to a text file.

💻 2. Google Colab Resources

We’ll use Google Colab for coding exercises.
Colab is a cloud-based Jupyter Notebook service that lets you write and run code in separate cells — perfect for testing and debugging. It even provides free GPUs/TPUs for compute-intensive tasks.

🔢 3. NumPy Resources

NumPy (Numerical Python) is the foundation of most AI/ML work. It provides tools for linear algebra, random number generation, and fast array operations.
You’ll use NumPy to handle Q-tables and perform mathematical operations efficiently.

Recommended Resource:

🌐 W3Schools NumPy Tutorial

Practice Ideas:

Create a 2D array and find its mean, max, and min.

Generate a random matrix and perform element-wise addition.

Save and load arrays using np.save() and np.load().

📊 4. Matplotlib Resources

Matplotlib is Python’s go-to plotting library.
You’ll use it later to visualize training progress (e.g., average reward per episode).

Recommended Resource:

🌐 Matplotlib Official Website

Practice Ideas:

Plot a line graph of y = x² for x from 0 to 10.

Plot a random reward curve to simulate training progress.

Label your axes and add a legend/title to the plot.

🎮 5. PyGame Resources

PyGame allows you to build simple 2D games and is what we’ll use to create the Flappy Bird environment.
You’ll learn about:

The game loop (update → draw → event handling)

Keyboard inputs and physics (gravity, flap motion)

Collision detection

Recommended Resources:

🎥 PyGame Tutorial for Beginners – freeCodeCamp

🌐 PyGame Documentation

Practice Ideas:

Draw a moving circle (“bird”) on the screen.

Implement basic gravity — bird falls down unless you press a key.

Add simple obstacles (rectangles) and detect collisions.

✅ End of Week-1 Goals

By the end of this week, you should be able to:

Write Python scripts and functions confidently.

Use NumPy for basic array operations.

Visualize data using Matplotlib.

Create a simple interactive PyGame window.
